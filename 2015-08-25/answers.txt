1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

Let us assume time as follows.
 S = Start up overhead
 C = Time to count one student
 N = Number of students
 R = Number of rows
 G = Time for the instructor to gather counts
 A = Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Time = S + C * (N/R) + G * (N/R) + A

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

Time = C * N

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

I am not sure
