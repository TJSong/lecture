0. The day before lecture, 1hr

1. Difference between Mutext and Conditional variables

2. a) A = Time in critical section : N/B * t_update
      B = Time in Batch : N/P * t_trial
	  T = A + B

   b) N=1000000000, B1=10000, B2=20000, B3=5000

   c) We can sweep the t_trial. 

3. We can put lock and unlock function to wherever TOD function exists. I
modified the source code.
