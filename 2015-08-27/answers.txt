1. By Amdalh's law : Speedup = 1 / (0.1 + 0.9/p)
	(where p is the number of cores)

	So, the speedup (p==128) is around 9.34, and the effiency is speedup/p, so 0.073.

2. Throughput = tasks/time = tasks/ (tasks * alpha) = 1/alpha

3. When it is run once, and never run afterward.

4. I am not sure.

5. My laptop has four cores.
